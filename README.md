- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Nordson-Rudy

## Who am I.
I'm a new hire for Nordson Asymtech, working on growing my knowledge base with the Sequoia project.

If that doesn't make sense to you then you likely aren't working for Nordson or it's affiliates.
In which case you may be interested in my personal profile @ Github.com/JustRudyRodriguez
